### Project Description

TeamFill is a mobile-first web application that allows for a group of users to organize, discover and participate in pickup sports matches. TeamFill aims to remove the hassles associated with trying to find players to play with by delivering an excellent UI experience that minimizes the effort required from the user. This application will allow users to discover pickup sports events organized by other users that are happening in their area. Players (teams) will be able to find the best available team (player) for the sport they would like to play. Current solutions attempting to solve this problem do not attempt to find the best player, but rather find the first available player. Furthemore, using a real-time notification system, available players will be notified immediately when a potential team would like to recruit them, enabling games to begin quicker. By creating a pipeline for lone players to be matched with groups looking to round out their teams, this application aims to promote physical activity and social engagement.

### Components
 TeamFill was built using ReactJs and NodeJs, where Firebase was utilized as the NoSQL Database.
